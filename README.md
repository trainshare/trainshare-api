# Trainshare

An API for the trainshare apps which will connect you with your friends traveling by train.

## Setup (OSX) - For running the API

Since OSX has no real packet manager go ahead and [install Homebrew](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/installation).

Then go ahead and install Neo4j aswell as MySQL.

    $ brew install neo4j
    $ brew install mysql
    
Import the [database dump](http://philippkueng.ch/files/trainsharing_routes.sql) used to make the matches into your MySQL Database.

Now, if you haven't installed Node.js yet go ahead and follow the steps below.

    $ git clone git://github.com/joyent/node.git
    $ cd node/
    $ git checkout v0.6.12 (or latest stable release at that time)
    $ ./configure
    $ sudo make
    $ sudo make install

As a final step clone this repo and install the npm dependencies.

    $ git clone git://github.com/philippkueng/trainsharingApp.git
    $ cd trainsharingApp/
    $ npm install
  
And run it.

    $ node app.js
