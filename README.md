# Trainshare

An API for the trainshare apps which will connect you with your friends traveling by train.

## Setup (OSX) - For running the API

Since OSX has no real packet manager go ahead and [install Homebrew](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/installation).

Then go ahead and install Neo4j aswell as MySQL.

  $ brew install neo4j
  $ brew install mysql

Now, if you haven't installed Node.js yet go ahead and follow the steps below.

  $ git clone git://github.com/joyent/node.git
  $ cd node/
  $ git checkout v0.6.12 (or latest stable release at that time)
  $ ./configure
  $ sudo make
  $ sudo make install

As a final step clone this repo and install the npm dependencies.

  $ git clone git://github.com/philippkueng/trainsharingApp.git
  $ cd trainsharingApp/
  $ npm install
  
And run it.

  $ node app.js
